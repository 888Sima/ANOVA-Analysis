# ANOVA-Analysis:

# Part One Using R 

https://www.rpubs.com/simasiami/383921

# Part Two Using Python: Two-Way ANOVA model 

Data Generation: The script creates synthetic data with two factors, each with multiple levels, and a continuous response variable.

Model Fitting: It fits a Two-Way ANOVA model to the generated data using statsmodels to assess the effects of the two factors and their interaction.

Results: The script prints an ANOVA table that summarizes the statistical significance of each factor and their interaction.

Visualization: The script generates two types of plots:

ANOVA Table: Provides statistical significance of the factors and their interaction.
Interaction Plot: Shows the interaction effects between the two factors.
Boxplot: Displays the distribution of the response variable across different levels of the factors.
